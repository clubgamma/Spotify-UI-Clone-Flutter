  - **READ CODE OF CONDUCT** 
     
     Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/clubgamma/code-of-conduct) before starting contributing.

### Getting Started ###

1.  If you are new to Git and GitHub, it is advisable that you go through
    [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
    **before** moving to ahead.
    
2. Pick any issue you want to work on from the [issues](https://github.com/clubgamma/Spotify-UI-Clone-Flutter/issues), discuss with maintainer on issue and then start.

2.  Fork the project on GitHub.
    [Help Guide to Fork a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo/).

    After a sucessful fork, you'll see a copy of this repo in your own account.


3.  Clone the project.
    
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/clubgamma/Spotify-UI-Clone-Flutter
    ```
    
    [Help Guide to Clone a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

4.  Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.

    ```shell
    git checkout -b branch-name
    ```

5.  Open up the project in your favorite text editor.

    Select the file you want to contribute to, and make your changes.

    If you are making changes to the `README.md` file, you would need to have
    Markdown knowledge. Visit
    [here to read about GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    and
    [here to practice](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

6.  Add your modified
    files to git, [How to Add, Commit, Push, and Go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2/).

    ```shell
    git add path/to/filename.ext
    ```

    You can also add all unstaged files using:

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

    **Note:** using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a
    `git status` to see your changes, but do it **before** `git add`.

6.  Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
    ```

7.  Push your commits to your GitHub Fork:

    ```shell
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```

8.  Submit a pull request.
